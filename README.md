## Introduction

This was the first project after the course on responsiveness.  In this course
I followed the best practices of using media queries to arrange the content of
the page on different screens, I also used Gulp to automate tasks as the image
resolutions, minify javascript, compile sass in Css and minify Css too and I
also use semantic HTML tags and srcset to set the appropriate image for every
screen size and resolution.
